# Price Formatter

Converts a string in a particular format (e.g. `3245.000000`) to another particular format (e.g. `3 245`). For more examples, refer to the tests.

In order to work, requires Python 3. You can either import `format_price` function or use the CLI interface:
```bash
$ python format_price.py
Enter the price to process (e.g. "3245.000000"): 1233245.013000
1 233 245,013
```

Run the tests: `python tests.py`.
